This project is solely based on what I've learned through various online tutorials.
These covers the basics of C++ and some fundamentals of programming. Covered mostly
on the command line.

With this project, I've wanted to apply and polish my skills and try to experience
what to think when executing what I've thought and if it is possible. These are just
baby steps to achieve bigger things in life.

I also plan to continuously work hard to train myself and be familiar with different
syntaxes, algorithms, and database within the near future. As this is the first one
I've made, there are many bugs and unpolished codes within the application itself.

Thank you for reading and please criticize my code so I can further understand and
see my lapses as a starting programmer.
